Current features:

* Not Electron
* Voice support
* Handles most types of chat messages including embeds, images, and replies
* Completely styleable/customizable
* Identifies to Discord as the web client unlike other clients so less likely to be falsely flagged as spam<sup>1</sup>
* Set status
* Unread and mention indicators
* Notifications (non-Windows)
* Start new DMs and group DMs
* View user profiles (notes, mutual servers, mutual friends)
* Kick, ban, and unban members
* Modify roles and modify members' roles
* Manage invites
* Manage emojis
* View audit log
* Emojis<sup>2</sup>
* Thread support<sup>3</sup>
* Animated avatars, server icons, emojis (can be turned off)

1 - Abaddon tries its best (though is not perfect) to make Discord think it's a legitimate web client. Some of the
things done to do this
include: using a browser user agent, sending the same IDENTIFY message that the official web client does, using API v9
endpoints in all cases, and not using endpoints the web client does not normally use. There are still a few smaller
inconsistencies, however. For example the web client sends lots of telemetry via the `/science` endpoint (uBlock origin
stops this) as well as in the headers of all requests.<br>

**See [here](#the-spam-filter)** for things you might want to avoid if you are worried about being caught in the spam
filter.

2 - Unicode emojis are substituted manually as opposed to rendered by GTK on non-Windows platforms. This can be changed
with the `stock_emojis` setting as shown at the bottom of this README. A CBDT-based font using Twemoji is provided to
allow GTK to render emojis natively on Windows.

3 - There are some inconsistencies with thread state that might be encountered in some more uncommon cases, but they are
the result of fundamental issues with Discord's thread implementation.

2. `git clone --recurse-submodules="subprojects" https://github.com/uowuo/abaddon && cd abaddon`
3. `mkdir build && cd build`
4. `cmake -GNinja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo ..`
5. `ninja`

3. `mkdir build && cd build`
4. `cmake ..`
5. `make`
6. [Copy resources](#resources)

#### Linux:

1. Install dependencies
    * On Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy)/Debian 12 (bookworm) and newer:
      ```Shell
      $ sudo apt install g++ cmake libgtkmm-3.0-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev libsqlite3-dev libssl-dev nlohmann-json3-dev libhandy-1-dev libsecret-1-dev libopus-dev libsodium-dev libspdlog-dev

### Downloads:

Latest release version: https://github.com/uowuo/abaddon/releases/latest

**CI:**

- Windows: [here](https://nightly.link/uowuo/abaddon/workflows/ci/master/build-windows-msys2-MinSizeRel.zip)
- MacOS: [here](https://nightly.link/uowuo/abaddon/workflows/ci/master/build-macos-RelWithDebInfo.zip) unsigned,
  unpackaged, requires gtkmm3 (e.g. from homebrew)
- Linux: [here](https://nightly.link/uowuo/abaddon/workflows/ci/master/build-linux-MinSizeRel.zip) unpackaged (for now),
  requires gtkmm3. built on Ubuntu 22.04 + gcc9

> **Warning**: If you use Windows, make sure to start from the `bin` directory

#### Resources

The two folders within the `res` folder (`res/res` and `res/css`) are necessary. Windows also uses the `fonts` folder.
You can put them directly next to the executable. On Linux, `css` and `res` can also be loaded from
`~/.local/share/abaddon` or `/usr/share/abaddon`

`abaddon.ini` will also be automatically used if located at `~/.config/abaddon/abaddon.ini` and there is
no `abaddon.ini` in the working directory

#### How do I get my token?

Follow [these](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/issues/76#issuecomment-410067054) instructions.

#### The Spam Filter

Discord likes disabling accounts/forcing them to reset their passwords if they think the user is a spam bot or
potentially had their account compromised. While the official client still often gets users caught in the spam filter,
third party clients tend to upset the spam filter more often. If you get caught by it, you can
usually [appeal](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000029731) it and get it restored.
Here are some things you might want to do with the official client instead if you are particularly afraid of evoking the
spam filter's wrath:

* Joining or leaving servers (usually main cause of getting caught)
* Frequently disconnecting and reconnecting
* Starting new DMs with people
* Managing your friends list
* Managing your user profile while connected to a third party client

### Settings

Settings are configured (for now) by editing `abaddon.ini`.
The format is similar to the standard Windows ini format **except**:

* `#` is used to begin comments as opposed to `;`
* Section and key names are case-sensitive

> **Warning**: You should edit these while the client is closed, even though there's an option to reload while running.

This listing is organized by section.
For example, memory_db would be set by adding `memory_db = true` under the line `[discord]`
